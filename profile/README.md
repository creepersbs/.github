# Creepers.sbs - Another free subdomain provider
![Banner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creepersbs/.github/refs/heads/main/profile/mini-banner.png)
This free subdomain powered by [**`CreeperHUB`**](https://creeperhub.net) and [**`Giocoliere`**](https://giocoliere.dev). It works only with donations and my own wallet (who's not infinite) so please consider a [**`donation`**](https::/creepers.sbs/donate) <3

----------------------------------

Take ur free subdomain for developers, MC players, MC servers for free without needing credit card. 

> [!NOTE]
> "Sub" subdomains (like `something.example.creepers.sbs`) are supported too. But then the file has to be called `something.example.json` to register `something.example.creepers.sbs`
