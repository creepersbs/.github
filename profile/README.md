[![Banner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creepersbs/.github/refs/heads/main/profile/mini-banner.png)](https://creepers.sbs)
This free subdomain powered by [**`CreeperHUB`**](https://creeperhub.net) / [**`Giocoliere`**](https://giocoliere.dev). It works only with donations and my own wallet (which is not endless) so please consider a [**`donation`**](#donations) <3

----------------------------------

Take your free subdomain for developers, MC players, MC servers for free without needing any credit card. 

> [!NOTE]
> "Sub" subdomains (like `something.example.creepers.sbs`) are supported too. But then the file has to be called (for ex) `something.example.json` to register `something.example.creepers.sbs`
